	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Our company exists since 1974 and it is perhaps the oldest car rental company on the Costa del Sol. We offer cheap all inclusive professional car rental.
Today we have 4 offices: Malaga, Nerja, Torre del Mar and Torrox, on the famous golf coast of Spain.

We can offer car hire anywhere on the Costa del Sol of Málaga.
“The best climate in the costa del sol” Torrox Costa and Torre del Mar by all accounts this is a pretty accurate description of the weather in these parts. Torrox Costa lies 6 kilometres west of Nerja whilst its parent, inland village of Torrox is just 3 kilometres to the north. Torrox village marks the origin of this town whilst Torre del Mar has built up over the last 30 years and developed into a thriving tourist resort.

The village of Torrox retains much of its original charm, a typical Andalucian village with its narrow streets and local shops and restaurants. The main square is a delight to take morning coffee, enjoy the local tapas bars and watch the world go by. The outskirts of the village have expanded with new developments and apartment complexes to cater for the local population.</p>
